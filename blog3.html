        <h2>The Bias in AI and Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence is always advertised as unbiased tool but in
          reality, it reflects the biases of people who created it. AI‚Äôs bias
          has been shown in different AI tools such as hiring systems which are
          more favor male applicants to facial recognition systems that lots of
          time have problem to recognize woman or people of color. But how AI,
          which is like an artificial mind, has human bias?
        </p>

        <h3>How AI Becomes Biased</h3>
        <p>
          AI systems get trained based on huge datasets and these datasets are
          based on real world information. If the data that feed to them has
          biases, AI absorb this information and apply them to its algorithms.
          For instance, if a hiring algorithm is trained based on past hiring
          data that was lean toward hiring men, then it will prefer to choose
          male candidate over female ones. Also, facial recognition has the same
          system. Since it was mostly trained on white male faces, now it has
          trouble to recognize women or people of color faces. AI is not biased
          on itself; the problem is with the sources it learns from, and these
          resources are based the inequal world what we are living in right now.
          A real world example is Amazon hiring system that was found that when
          the word ‚Äòwoman‚Äô is on candidate‚Äôs resume, it automatically reduced
          the chances of the resume to get selected. For example, it was written
          woman‚Äôs chess club. This happened because the AI was trained from male
          dominated hiring process and it was assuming men are a better fit for
          roles. (Dastin, 2018)
        </p>
        <h3>The consequences of AI bias</h3>
        <p>
          AI bias has different consequences. In hiring process, it can prevent
          qualified women candidates from getting the opportunity to get hired.
          Or in criminal justice, it can lead predictive police algorithms to
          unfairly target minorities. In Healthcare, AI models are mostly
          trained on men patients which can lead them to fail diagnose diseases
          correctly on women body. These biases push existing inequalities even
          more.
        </p>
        <h3>How we can fix it?</h3>
        <p>
          The good news is that it can be fixed. The first step is to
          acknowledge that AI bias exists, and we need to take action to fix it.
          Then companies need to diversify their AI training team who train AI
          models in a way that they make sure the data that AI gets trained on,
          have different perspectives. If just men design and train AI models,
          they might not notice that their system disadvantages women. Another
          solution is improving the datasets. These datasets that are fed to AI
          models need to get updated and reviewed before giving them to AI
          models to ensure that they present diversity in their outputs.
          Finally, governments need to set some regulations for AI technology.
          They need to implement ethical standards to guarantee that companies
          take responsibility for what they make and put in their AI models. AI
          should be a tool to progress, not be another barrier for people in the
          society.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          AI has potential to change the world and the way we live but if it‚Äôs
          not built carefully and trained with biased data, it could make the
          existing inequality even worse. As technology and AI grows, we need to
          make sure to take steps in right path, with diverse representation in
          tech, stronger ethical guidelines and better datasets. The future with
          AI should be the one that works for everyone, not just enforce the
          traditional biases.
