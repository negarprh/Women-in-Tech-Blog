        <h2>Deepfake Technology and the Exploitation of Women</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence gave us an incredible power to create anything
          and be innovative as much as our imagination goes, but it has also
          introduced a new danger especially for women. One of the most
          dangerous examples is deepfake technology which can create a very
          realistic fake videos or images. Deepfakes have already been used in
          entertainment industry but now with development of technology and AI,
          it gets more accessible to everyone and it increasingly weaponized
          against women. This post demonstrates how deepfake technology target
          women in an inappropriate way, its dangers and what can be done about
          it.
        </p>

        <h3>How Deepfake Technology Target Women</h3>
        <p>
          Deepfake AI can manipulate images and videos to make it look like
          someone did something they never did. Research shows that 96% of
          deepfake videos online are pornographic and 99% of victims are women
          (Columbia SIPA, 2019). These videos are usually used to harass,
          blackmail or humiliate women. A famous example is the case of Scarlett
          Johansson, whose face was used in fake explicit videos without her
          consent. She spoke up against this issue and mentioned how little
          control victims have over this situation (The Verge, 2024). Even a
          very famous figure such as Scarlet Johansson is struggling with this
          issue and trying to remove deepfake videos. Easy access to AI tools
          means almost everyone can create deepfakes and it makes this problem a
          growing issue.
        </p>
        <h3>Consequences of Deepfake Abuse</h3>
        <p>
          Deepfake content can ruin people's reputation, cause them to struggle
          with psychological problems and even job loss. The lack of clear
          guidelines and laws to limit individuals from abusing deepfake
          technology makes it difficult for victims to seek justice. Also, many
          social platforms fail to act quickly and remove damaging content,
          which leads to spreading these contents world widely. Also, deepfakes
          contribute to spreading misinformation. Fake videos can be used to
          manipulate political narrative and destroy repetition. When these
          videos are more common on media, it‚Äôs hard for people to distinguish
          what is fake and what is real.
        </p>
        <h3>What Can Be Done?</h3>
        <p>
          To solve this problem, governments need to set stronger and stricter
          laws to make nonconsensual deepfake creation and sharing illegal. Some
          countries might set these laws, but making other countries follow can
          be challenging, which means there needs to be international laws to
          limit these activities and hold people accountable. Additionally, tech
          companies need to improve their AI detection systems to track these
          contents in different platforms and take them down quickly. Investing
          more in AI development would help to achieve this goal faster.
          Finally, awareness is the key. Educate people to how to recognize
          deepfake videos or images and spread awareness that how harmful they
          are. Also, there needs to be a better support system for victims to be
          able to seek justice.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          Deepfake technology is a powerful tool but in wrong hands, it can harm
          people and be weaponized against women. There need to be proper laws
          and guidelines and better detection technology to fight against
          deepfake exploitation and protect individuals especially women since
          based on the research they are the main target.
