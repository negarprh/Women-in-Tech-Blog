        <h2>The Forgotten Innovators: Women Who Shaped the Tech Industry</h2>
        <p>
          These days when we think about tech industry, names that first pops up
          to people‚Äôs mind are names like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. However,
          many people do not realize that some of the most important foundations
          of computing were led by women. Women once were the leader of
          technological innovations, and their contributions shaped the digital
          world that we are living in right now. But how women went from being
          pioneers in tech industry to being pushed in the background? In this
          blog, I demonstrate the history of women in tech, major contributions
          they made and how things changed.
        </p>

        <h3>Women Who Built the Tech Industry</h3>
        <p>
          Women played a major role in developing programming filed, long before
          it counts as a significant industry. For instance, Ada Lovelace in
          1800s wrote the first computer algorithm. Her work is a foundation for
          what later became programming. In the 20th century, women played a
          major role in computing progress. During World War 2, women like
          ‚ÄúENIAC Women‚Äù programmed one of the first electronic computers.
          Although their work was forgotten, they developed early software and
          made a key contribution to computing. Another important figure is
          Grace Hopper who helped to develop the first computer compiler and
          played a major role in creating COBOL. COBOL is a programming language
          that still wildly use in companies. She believed that computers should
          be accessible to more people and her work helped to fill the gap
          between machines and users.

        <h3>How Women Were Pushed Out of Tech</h3>
        <p>
          In early days of computing, programming was counted as a women work
          but by the time when tech industry became profitable, men started to
          take over the industry and women were gradually pushed out. The number
          of women in computing by the 1980s was sharply declined. One of the
          major reasons of this shift was in marketing and education. Personal
          computers were advertised to boys, and it enforced the idea that tech
          was a male field. Also, universities and hiring systems prioritized
          male candidates and discourage women to enter this industry.
        </p>
        <h3>Fighting for Representation</h3>
        <p>
          Although there are many setbacks, women are trying to reclaim their
          place in tech industry. Role models like Radia Perlman who is also
          known for ‚ÄúMother of the Internet‚Äù for her work on network protocols
          or Fei-Fei Li who is a leading researcher in AI, are the inspiring
          figures for other women to pursue tech industry. Nowadays,
          organizations such as Girls Who Code are providing resource and
          helping women to pursue tech fields.
        </p>
        <h3>How to Support Women in Tech</h3>
        <p>
          First step is to recognize the work women did in tech industry.
          Societies need to encourage young girls to pursue STEM fields.
          Government and educational system need to provide support and
          mentorship equally for everyone to ensure that there are equal chances
          to every member of the society. The history of women in tech is a
          reminder that innovation is not tied to gender, and we can build a
          more inclusive industry where everyone can contribute.
